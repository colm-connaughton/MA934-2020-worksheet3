    "\n",
    "The custom module MA934.jl defines some useful data structures and some functions that operate on them. You should familiarise yourself with how Julia modules are structured and structure your own code accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composite type **KeyValuePair** defines a simple data structure to represent an (**Int64**, **Float64**) key-value pair. \n",

    "\n",
    "The recursive type **FTree** defines a Fenwick tree that stores a **KeyValuePair** at each leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many languages have a keyword NULL which can be assigned to an object to indicate that it has not yet been initialised. Julia does not have this feature: accessing an object that has not yet been initialised throws an error. On the other hand, Julia does have a **Nothing** type which represents an object with no fields. This is not quite the same thing however: an object of type **LinkedList**, for example, cannot be assigned a value of type **Nothing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive data structures often use an uninitialised object to denote the end of a list, a leaf of a tree etc. This is a problem in Julia: if an object is uninitialised you cannot access it to check whether it is initialised without throwing an error. One work around for situations where a value x of type **T** exists only sometimes, the **Union{T, Nothing}** type can be used for function arguments, object fields and array element types. This approach is adopted in the MA934.jl module. More information can be found at https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/faq/#faq-nothing-1\n",

    "The Gillespie algorithm is a dynamic Monte Carlo algorithm that generates statistically correct realisations of a continous time Markov process. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm It is used heavily in stochastic simulation of chemical and biological reaction networks and population dynamics. In this question we use it to simulate one-dimensional diffusion of heterogeneous particles whose diffusion constants are independently drawn from an exponential distribution.\n",

    "1. Create a list $\\left\\{(i, r_i), i=1,\\ldots M\\right\\}$,  of all possible transitions (events), $i$, that can occur in the system and the corresponding transition rates, $r_i$.\n",
    "2. Calculate the total rate\n",
    "$$R = \\sum_{i=1}^M r_i$$\n",

    "3. Generate a uniform random number in the range $[0,R]$ and determine which interval it falls in. \n",
    "4. Perform the corresponding transition and update the time variable by an amount $\\Delta t = 1/R$.\n",
    "5. Repeat until the desired simulation time is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be concrete, suppose with have $N$ particles on the interval $[-L, L]$ initially located at $x=0$. Each particle can hop a distance $\\Delta x$ to the left or to the right with equal probability. The rate of hopping is initially considered to be the same for all particles:\n",

    "1. There are $M= 2 N$ possible transitions at each step: each of $N$ particles can hop a distance $\\Delta x$ either left or right with the above rates. We index them as follows: events k=1:N correspond to particle k hopping to the right, events k=N+1:2N correspond to particle k-N hopping to the left.\n",
    "2. The total rate is \n",
    "$$ R = \\frac{D N}{(\\Delta x)^2}.$$\n",
    "3. Generate a uniform random number in the range $[0,R]$ and determine the index $k$ of particle to move and the direction.\n",
